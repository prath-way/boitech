## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Storage Considerations
- Files are stored as base64 in localStorage
- Base64 encoding increases file size by ~33%
- localStorage has a ~5-10MB limit per domain
- Monitor storage with `getStorageSize()`

### Best Practices
1. **Recommend users to:**
   - Keep file sizes reasonable (under 5MB)
   - Compress images before upload if possible
   - Regularly export/backup important attachments

2. **Storage Management:**
   ```typescript
   import { clearOldAttachments } from '@/lib/healthJournalStorage';
   
   // Clear attachments older than 90 days
   clearOldAttachments(90);
   ```

3. **Future Enhancements:**
   - Consider cloud storage (Supabase) for larger files
   - Image compression before storage
   - Batch download functionality
   - Export attachments separately

## üîí Security & Privacy

- All data stored locally in browser
- No files uploaded to servers
- Base64 encoding (not encryption)
- Users should avoid uploading highly sensitive data without additional encryption

## üêõ Known Limitations

1. **Storage Space**
   - Limited by browser's localStorage (~5-10MB)
   - Large files can fill storage quickly
   - Consider implementing warnings at 80% capacity

2. **PDF Preview**
   - PDFs show file info only (no inline preview)
   - Users must download to view content

3. **Browser Compatibility**
   - FileReader API required (supported in all modern browsers)
   - No IE11 support

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

### Recommended Next Steps:
1. **Cloud Storage Integration**
   - Use Supabase Storage for larger files
   - Sync across devices

2. **Image Compression**
   - Automatically compress images before storage
   - Maintain quality while reducing size

3. **OCR Integration**
   - Extract text from lab results
   - Auto-populate fields from prescriptions

4. **Progress Tracking**
   - Compare before/after photos
   - Timeline view of visual changes

5. **Share & Export**
   - Email attachments directly to doctors
   - Bulk export with journal entries

## üìä Technical Details

### Data Structure
```typescript
interface Attachment {
  id: string;              // Unique identifier
  type: AttachmentType;    // image | document | lab_result | prescription
  fileName: string;        // Original filename
  fileSize: number;        // Size in bytes
  dataUrl: string;         // Base64 data URL
  caption?: string;        // Optional description

}
```
